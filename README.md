## Description
The following is a note-taker application for storing, tracking, and updating notes. On the notes page, you can view, update, or delete existing notes and create new ones. The application stores notes following refresh as persistent data so you can return to the application at any time and pick up your note taking wherever you left off. Express.js is used throughout to handle all routes between the client and the db.json file.

To use the project navigate to the link above and open the deployed application.  The user will be directed to a landing page with the title of the application and a subtitle indicating the use of express.js.  At the landing page, the user can click on a button to 'Get Started'. Clicking get started navigates the user away from the landing page and brings them to the /notes page.  On the left hand side of the screen will list any existing notes, and in the right column will be a field for Note Title and Note Text. Filling in the Note Title and Note Text fields with your own information about the notes will provide options to save the note or clear the form to start over in the top right hand corner of the screen.  Hitting save note moves your note instantly over to the lefthand column on the screen, and you can enter as many notes as you'd like.  If you'd like to revisit an already written note, click on the title of the note and it will pop up in the main section of the screen.  From here you can either click on other notes to view them, choose to write a new note by clicking the button that appears in the righthand corner of the screen, continue to view the same note, or click the little red garbage can icon to delete any notes in the lefthand side of the screen, including the selected note.  The note will instantly be deleted and you can move on with the rest of your to-do list.
